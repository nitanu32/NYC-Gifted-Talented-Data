# NYC Gifted & Talented Data

This dataset was found on https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2018/04/19/datasets-for-data-cleaning-practice/ (at the bottom of the page). I combined the given 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 data for a larger and messier dataset. This is my attempt at cleaning data to perform Exploratory Data Analysis using Linear Regression, and I also tested my Data Visualization skills

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Datetime module
